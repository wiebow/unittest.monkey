summary: A test defines a set of test methods to test.
Extend [b]TestBase[/b] to define your own tests. You [b]MUST[/b] end the extended class name with 'Test', otherwise your test is not found.

End a method name with [i]Before[/i] and initialize any variables/data in that method.
End a method name with [i]After[/i] to release any permanent resources you allocated in the setup.
End a method name with [i]BeforeClass[/i] to initialize variables/data you need for the class test.
End a method name with [i]AfterClass[/i] to released any permanent resources you allocated in the setup.
For each test method you want to run, end the name with [i]Test[/i].

Any methods not using this naming scheme are ignored.
